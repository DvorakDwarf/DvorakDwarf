### Hey ðŸ‘‹

Not working on Infinite Storage Glitch. Please do no message about fixing it.\

I am me. I like coding projects for fun and using Rust. 

Contact over discord, preferably. Please do not add me just to have me on the friends list. \
**Discord: histidinedwarf** \
I also check email and less often mastodon, twitter.

I post videos on some projects occasionally through [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9yOoyuHyFwTTrw47GKKp8w)
