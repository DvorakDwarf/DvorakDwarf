I am me. I like coding AI and using Rust, despite the two not meshing together. 

Contact over discord, preferably. Please do not add me just to have me on the friends list. \
**Discord: histidinedwarf** \
I also check email and less often twitter.

Not working on Infinite Storage Glitch anymore but it still works \
I post videos on some projects occasionally through [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9yOoyuHyFwTTrw47GKKp8w) \
Idk why but a quarter of views on the ISG video used to be from Japan 


Some dude asked for a buymeacoffee page so now I have one. Help with future college if you like my stuff \
